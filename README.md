This is a very good user control to build your own Windows Explorer. But his proejct hadn't been maintained for several years. So I recompiled it, and did some improvments. The good thing is that I create new user contol which name is ExpListLib for list view based on Jim Parsells code. This will help us to build our own Windows Explorer easier.
