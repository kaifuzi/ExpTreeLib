'''<summary>The CtvDropWrapper class deals with the mechanics of receiving a
''' Drag/Drop operation for a TreeView Control. In effect, it implements the IDropTarget interface
''' for a TreeView. It is designed to handle a TreeView which <b>must</b> have CShItems 
''' in the Tags of the TreeNodes contained in the control.
'''</summary>
'''<remarks>
''' <para>The class recieves the DragEnter, DragLeave, DragOver, and DragDrop events for
''' the associated TreeView, performs the Drag specific processing, and raises corresponding 
''' Events for the associated TreeView to allow the TreeView to do any GUI related processing.</para>
''' The interesting part of this class is that it makes no decisions about the drag
''' nor does any Drop related processing itself. Instead, it acts as a broker between
''' the Drag/Drop operation and the IDropTarget interface of the underlying 
''' Shell Folder.  This allows the Shell Folder, which may be a Shell Extention, to
''' perform whatever action it needs to in order to effect the Drag/Drop.
''' The benefit of this approach is that Drag/Drop targets need not be part of the
''' File System.
