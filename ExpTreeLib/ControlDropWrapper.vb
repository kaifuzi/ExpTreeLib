''' <summary>
''' A Class to serve as a broker between a Control that is associated with a single Folder and
'''  a DragTo/DropOn operation initiated From any other DragSource that the Shell supports. The calling application may change 
''' the associated Folder of an instance of ControlDropWrapper as needed - it is not needed or desireable to create new a instance
''' as the associated Folder changes.<br />
'''  This should not be used for TreeView or ListView Controls which require special handling.
''' </summary>
''' <remarks>Originally the targeted use of this Class was for DragSources that provide email items,however it will also work
'''          for Drags from WinExplorer or any application that provides an IDataObject with appropriately formatted data.</remarks>
